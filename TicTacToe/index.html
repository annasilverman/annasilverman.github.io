                <p><strong>Why I Liked It:</strong> This article was given to me as a reading in my DTC 101 class, and it's always kind of stuck with me. 
                    I tend to think about ways we can make this world easier for other people a lot. Understanding 
                    how things such as the clarity of someone in a photo make such an impact on how they and other people see them. </p>
